# rp2040 Web Thing

Final project of Enabling Technologies for IIoT Summer School by University of Pisa, 2022.

The objective is to develop a movement classification sensor on an arduino board  (using embedded ML capabilities of the hardware) and expose its functionality either: 

- by sending the events through an MQTT topic
- by sending events with Coap protocol (pub/sub mode)
- by wrapping it as a "Web Thing" using the WebThings interoperability paradigm, and monitoring it via a WebThings gateway (available as Docker container, or installed on a Raspberry pi)


### Required hardware:
- Arduino Nano rp2040 connect

### Relevant libraries:
